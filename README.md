# Movies

My project, titled 'Movies,' offers a convenient and user-friendly platform for
exploring movies. With a clean and intuitive interface, users can effortlessly
search for movies by title, genre, or actor and access detailed information
about each film.

For the frontend development, I utilized HTML and CSS to design a visually
appealing and responsive user interface, ensuring seamless browsing on various
devices. Leveraging the power of React.js, I implemented dynamic components to
enhance user interaction and experience. Axios was employed to efficiently fetch
data from external APIs, providing users with up-to-date movie details.

JSON was used for data storage and manipulation, allowing for easy integration
and retrieval of movie information within the application. The project is hosted
on GitHub, enabling easy collaboration and version control.

With 'Movies,' users can dive into the world of cinema with ease, discovering
their favorite movies and exploring new ones at their fingertips.
